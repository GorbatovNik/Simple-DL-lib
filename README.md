# Neural Network Library

A modular library for defining, training, and evaluating neural networks. It supports various layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers.

## Features

- **Layers**: Fully connected (Dense) layers.
- **Activations**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Linear.
- **Loss Functions**: Softmax Cross-Entropy, Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizers**: SGD, SGD with Momentum, Conjugate Gradient, Fletcher-Reeves, BFGS, BFGD-L.
- **Trainer**: Simplifies model training with configurable parameters.
- **Dataset**: MNIST support with preprocessing utilities (normalization, one-hot encoding).
